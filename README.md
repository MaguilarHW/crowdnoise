# crowd·noise

*make an album with your friends. sample the world. prove where every sound came from.*

</div>

## concept (what it is)

**crowd·noise** is a community-based, gamified music production app where groups of friends recreate well-known songs using **tiny recordings (≈0.1–10s)** captured from themselves + their environment. you transform those clips with an in‑app sound changer, layer them into a remake, and **unlock more of the album artwork as it improves**.

the twist: **every transformed sound keeps its provenance**—you can always reveal the original audio/video source and see the story behind the sample.

---

## goal / purpose (why it exists)

- **make music feel accessible**: no gear, no studio—just a phone and curiosity.
- **make collaboration the instrument**: friends split the work, trade samples, and build a shared library.
- **make sampling legible**: remakes are fun, but the “where did that sound come from?” moment is the point.

---

## what makes it different

- **album-reveal progression**: better remakes = more of the cover revealed (progress you can *see*).
- **provenance-first sampling**: any effect chain can be rewound to the original clip; credit is built in.
- **assignment-based collaboration**: the app can hand out “make this sound” tasks so everyone contributes.
- **indie, minimal ux**: lowercases, no clutter—like [untitled], but for collaborative remakes.

---

## target audience

- **people who love music** and want to make it with friends—especially without instruments or equipment
- broad age range; especially good for **hip-hop / sample-driven** listening habits (high remixability)
- users who want music to feel **less corporatized** and more playful + community-owned

## core loop (what you do)

1. form / join a group  
2. pick an album or song to remake  
3. the project shows the sounds you need (or assigns parts to teammates)  
4. record/upload micro-clips + trim fast  
5. transform clips with simple effects (sound changer)  
6. layer tracks into the remake + swap elements (e.g., “replace drums with our drums”)  
7. submit / share; get votes + climb leaderboards  
8. unlock more cover art; keep building your shared sample library  
9. anytime: open provenance and trace any sound back to its original clip

## ui (key screens)

| screen | vibe | what you see |
|---|---|---|
| **home** | calm + social | groups + active projects |
| **project** | focused | layered tracks with simple controls |
| **recording** | full-screen | one button, no clutter |
| **editing** | minimal | a few sliders + real-time preview |
| **album** | rewarding | artwork slowly revealed as progress is made |
| **provenance** | transparent | a clean chain showing where sounds came from |

## how i’ll communicate it (demo + story)

- **30-second hook**: “we remade a song using only table taps + keys + a basketball.”  
- **before/after moment**: play the original bar → play the remake bar → show the layer stack.  
- **provenance reveal**: tap a sound → watch it rewind to the original clip (credit + context).  
- **shareable artifacts**: export the remake + a provenance card (what we used + who made what).  
- **community angle**: feature weekly remakes + “hard albums” challenges with extra rewards.

## technical specifications (how it could be built)

- **technology stack**: mobile (ios + android); native or cross-platform; on-device recording/editing; backend for auth/projects/storage/feeds
- **architecture**: separate audio engine + project state from ui; async collaboration via project events; provenance as first-class data
- **data model (sketch)**: project / clip / sound (derived + effect chain + original pointer) / track layer
- **security & performance**: clear mic/camera permissions; per-project privacy; caching + background uploads; keep originals while streaming lightweight versions
- **core features**

- **recording / uploading**: capture short video/audio clips (≈0.1–10s) with fast trimming
- **sound changer**: simple effects to turn raw clips into usable instruments (preview in realtime)
- **replace sounds in a song**: swap original elements (e.g., drums) with your group’s sounds and hear the remake
- **layered mixing**: basic track stack (volume, mute/solo, timing nudges) without overwhelming controls
- **shared sample library**: save edited sounds with friends; reuse across projects
- **assignment system**: assign parts of a track to specific people (“you make this snare”) to drive collaboration
- **leaderboards + voting**: showcase album remakes; community votes on creativity + quality
- **difficulty ranking + rewards**: easier→harder albums/songs; bigger rewards for harder remakes
- **album unlock progression**: cover art reveals as your remake improves
- **provenance view (most important)**: tap any sound to reveal the original source clip and transformation chain

- **aesthetics (look)**: [untitled]-inspired minimalism—lowercases everywhere, clean spacing, calm hierarchy; recording + making should feel unblocked (few controls, obvious defaults, no clutter)
